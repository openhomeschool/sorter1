# The "sorter1" project
## openhome.school Computer Class

This project is just a container for student code, and some test data.
Students are to write code within the defined (but empty) sort() method, to sort 'items'.

## Details

**A "sort algorithm" is a bit of code that puts items in a certain order.**

You may want to use some of these...

```python
my_list = ['hi', 'bye']    # this creates a list with two items in it: 'hi' and 'bye'
my_list.append('another')  # this appends the word 'another' to the list, so that it now contains ['hi', 'bye', 'another']
print(my_list)             # this prints my_list, so that you can see that it now contains all 3 words
my_list.insert(1, 'chat')  # this inserts the word 'chat' at position 1, right after 'hi' (which is at position 0)
'hi' < 'bye'               # this returns false because, alphabetically, 'bye' is less than 'hi', so...
if 'hi' < 'bye':
   print('this will NOT be printed!')

for word in my_list:       # this steps through each word in my_list
	pass

```
